<p>Java Client and Web Client support "soft" and "hard" deletes for many Agile object classes. When you soft-delete an object in the database, it is not permanently deleted. A soft-deleted object is marked "Deleted" in the database, and its object number or name is reserved. You cannot create another object with the same type and number or name as a soft-deleted object.</p>
<p>When you run a search, soft-deleted objects do not appear in the search results table. To locate soft-deleted objects, you must run the predefined deleted object searches in the <span class="bold">Recycle Bin Searches</span> folder.</p>

<p>User access to Agile PLM can also be controlled by using the user profile Status property. For example, if someone leaves the company, or will no longer be using Agile PLM, or you need to prevent a user from logging in to the Agile PLM system, then disable the user object by setting the Status property to Inactive. The user remains listed on the Java Client Administrator <span class="bold">Users</span> node and on the Web Client Address Book <span class="bold">Users</span> tab, and the name still appears on existing workflows, escalations, and so forth, but the user will no longer appear in the Address Book for other users to select. You can reset the user to Active status at any time.</p>
<p>In Java Client Administrator, to display the list of deleted users, you can use either the <span class="bold">Deleted Users</span> node or the Recycle Bin search <span class="bold">Deleted Users</span>. In Agile Web Client, to display the list of deleted users, use the Recycle Bin search <span class="bold">Deleted Users</span>.</p>

<p>If you delete a user group to which users have been assigned, then you can do so without removing the users who were in the user group:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Global User Groups &ndash; when you soft-delete a global user group, the group is listed in the group members' user profile <span class="bold">Groups</span> tabs as an inactive group. When you hard-delete a global user group, the user assignments to that global user group are also deleted and do not appear on the user profile <span class="bold">Groups</span> tab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personal User Groups &ndash; For personal user groups, whether active or inactive, assignments are not listed on the group members' user profile <span class="bold">Groups</span> tabs.'</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you delete a user group, it is removed from the Agile PLM address book. You cannot delete a user group if it is in use in these cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is on any routable object signoff list on the routable object <span class="bold">Workflow</span> tab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is listed in any workflow definition Notify properties.</p>

<li>
<p>It is used as a designated escalation person for any users, user groups, and partners.</p>
